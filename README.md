# Mini Project for Computer Network's
Network Design for Shopping Complex

## Brief
Computer networks have a significant impact on the working of an organization.
Shopping Complexes nowadays depend on the proper functioning and analysis of
their networks for payment, billing/invoices, communication, helpdesk services,
checking availability of items etc. An efficient network is essential to facilitate the
systematic and cost-efficient transfer of information in an organization in the
form of messages, files, and resources. The project provides insights into various
concepts such as topology design, IP address configuration, and how to send
information in the form of packets to the wireless networks of different areas of a
shopping complex.
